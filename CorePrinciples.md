# ✅ **I. Core Principles Extracted from the Document**

*(Organized by the book's structural logic)*


---

## **1. Unit Economics & Capital Discipline (Part I)**

* AI shifts cost structure: every use has real-time marginal cost.
* Revenue ≠ profit in AI; contribution margin per feature is mandatory.
* Avoid “AI productivity” hype—only EBITDA-linked benefits matter.
* Default to **renting models**, not building; own data, rent intelligence.

## **2. Governance, Regulation & Energy Constraints**

* AI governance is about *documented oversight*, not technical mastery.
* Compliance frameworks (EU AI Act, NIST, ISO) define market access.
* Compute availability & carbon footprint are strategic bottlenecks.

## **3. Control Architecture for AI Agents (Part II)**

* Policies must be encoded into systems—“Policy as Code.”
* Circuit breakers & kill switches are mandatory for safety.
* Prevent “amoral drift” by bounding objective functions.
* Defend against competitor algorithms; ensure antitrust safety.
* Multi-vendor strategy is essential to avoid model outages.

## **4. Transparency & Auditability**

* Black-box AI is a liability; use “Glass Box” standards.
* Chain-of-thought logging for all critical decisions.
* Every AI agent must have identity, access scope, and traceability.

## **5. Real-Time Intelligence for Boards (Part III)**

* The Board must interrogate raw data via RAG—not rely on filtered summaries.
* Governance must shift from retrospective to predictive analytics.
* Digital twins and continuous simulations replace multi-year plans.

## **6. Human–Machine Centaur Model (Part IV)**

* AI augments—not replaces—Director judgment.
* Optimize cognitive bandwidth: automate shallow work; elevate deep work.
* Human premium = ethics, purpose, and boundaries for optimization.

## **7. Post-Labor Firm & Social Contract**

* Headcount is no longer a growth proxy.
* AI-driven workforce contraction requires ethical transition planning.
* Boards must define the “efficiency cap” to balance profit vs. welfare.

## **8. Monday Morning Governance Checklist (Part IV)**

* Audit: circuit breakers, autonomous spend controls.
* Risk: model vendor redundancy, collusion tests.
* Nom/Gov: AI literacy, systemic-risk-ready Board composition.

# ✅ **II. Action-Focused Summary (What the Board Must *Do*)**

*(Turned into operational imperatives)*


---

### **1. Financial Discipline**

* Demand **contribution margin** calculations for every AI feature.
* Reject initiatives without **direct EBITDA impact**.
* Enforce **Rent-First** AI architecture.

### **2. Regulatory Readiness**

* Map every product line to regulatory risk category (EU AI Act, NIST, ISO).
* Document the **Duty of Advanced Intelligence** for litigation defense.

### **3. AI Governance Architecture**

* Convert risk policies → **machine-executable rules**.
* Implement independent **kill switches** for AI-driven operations.
* Audit objective functions to prevent unethical optimizations.

### **4. Market Defense**

* Build a **multi-model redundancy plan**.

### **5. Transparency and Auditability**

* Mandate **explanatory logs** for automated decisions.
* Create individual **digital identities** for agent systems.

### **6. Data Access Revolution**

* Adopt a secure RAG system for Board data queries.
* Shift governance from **wake steering** to **radar steering**.
* Deploy digital twins for constant scenario simulation.

### **7. Workforce Transition Strategy**

* Redefine success metrics: **Value Per Employee** > headcount.
* Design reskilling & dignified exit pathways.
* Establish a Board-defined ethical boundary for automation.

### **8. Board Capability Upgrade**

* Require **AI literacy** for all Directors.
* Introduce AI “sparring partners” in Board strategy sessions.
* Update D&O insurance for **algorithmic negligence**.

* Align severance/reskilling plans with automation roadmap.

## **Step 8 – Monday Morning Checklist Execution**

* Committees review:

  * Circuit breakers
  * Collusion stress tests
  * Vendor failover plan
  * D&O policy coverage for algorithmic negligence.

# ✅ **VI. Real-World Test Scenarios**

*(Based directly on the document’s principles)*


---

### **Scenario 1 – Margin Collapse**

Your AI product sees a 5× user increase, but compute bill increases 18×.

* How would you apply contribution margin analysis?
* What circuit breaker prevents runaway cost?
* Do you scale back, reprice, or redesign?

### **Scenario 2 – Algorithmic Collusion Risk**

Your pricing AI and a competitor’s AI both increase prices simultaneously.

* How do you prove no tacit coordination?
* What logs or objective function constraints prevent antitrust liability?

### **Scenario 3 – Model Provider Outage**

OpenAI goes offline for 48 hours; your service depends on it.

* What “spare tire” do you activate?
* What % of traffic can fail over today?
* How does your Board communicate the incident?

### **Scenario 4 – Rogue Optimization**

An internal AI agent starts maximizing revenue by targeting vulnerable customers.

* What policy-as-code rule stops this?
* Which kill switch activates?
* Which committee investigates?

### **Scenario 5 – Regulatory Reclassification**

EU recategorizes your service as “High-Risk AI” overnight.

* What is your compliance impact?
* How do your product timelines and margins adjust?
* Does the Board suspend deployment?

### **Scenario 6 – Workforce Contraction**

Automation roadmap removes 1200 roles.

* What is your transition strategy?
* How do you manage brand trust & political backlash?
* What is your Board’s “efficiency cap”?

### **Scenario 7 – Board Data Interrogation**

Management reports “no major customer issues.”
You query RAG: 17 complaints reference “fraud.”

* What follow-up governance actions do you take?
* How do you test for asymmetry or withheld information?
